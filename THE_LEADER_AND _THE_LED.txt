The lion stakes his claim
To the leadership of the pack.

But the antelopes remember
The ferocious pounce of his paws

The hyena says the crown is made for him
But the impalas shudder at his lethal appetite.

The giraffe craves a place in the front
But his eyes are too far from the ground.

When the zebra says it's his right to lead
The pack points to the duplicity of his stripes.

The elephant trudges into the power tussle
But its colleagues dread his trampling feet.

The warthog is too ugly,
The rhino too riotous.

And the pack thrashes around
Like a snake without a head.

"Our need calls for a hybrid of habits."
Proclaims the forest sage,

"A little bit of a lion
a little bit if a lamb

Tough like a tiger, compassionate like a doe
Transparent like a river, mysterious like a lake

A leader who knows how to follow
Followers mindful of their right to lead."
