The leader is a pace-setter,
The led, a pace-follower.
The leader is a path-finder,
The led, a path-treader.

The leader is a vision-weaver,
The led, a vision-sharer.
The leader is a hope-kindler,
The led, a hope-upholder.

But when the leader becomes a dictator,
The led become slaves.
When the leader becomes a demagogue,
The led become mobs.

When the leader becomes a tyrant,
The led become victims.
When the leader becomes a oppressor,
The led become rebels.

Let us lead and be led
With wisdom, justice, and love.
