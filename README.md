The LEADER AND THE LED is a poem written by Niyi Osundare to creatively reflect the theme of power tussle in a settlement.
This project uses spaCy - a python NLP module - to attempt a linguistic analysis of the poem by extracting the nouns/nominal groups in the poem, thus revealing the poet's naming conventions.
PLEASE NOTE that the word 'LED' as used in the poem has been replaced with 'FOLLOWERS' for the sake of the project. This is due to the inability of the spaCy module to properly
place 'LED' as a noun (instead it places it as a verb as a result of the POS tagging of 'LED' in the transformer used (en-core-web-md).

This project can be used as the beginnning stage in an onomastics study of the poem, saving the literary critic a substantial time, as well as reducing the risk of human errors
in extracting the nominal groups as used in the poem.
